# Deploykit

A Deno based toolkit for generating deployment configuration files using
typescript with focus on k8s resources.\
Inspired by Pulumi, JKCfg, ts-kubernetes-models, CDK, Helm and others...

** This project is in very early and experimental stage

## Quick example

#### deploy.ts (./examples/deploy.ts)

```typescript
import { createMicroservice } from "https://deno.land/x/deploykit@0.0.23/blueprint/k8s/app.ts";
import {
  addDeployment,
  addService,
  expose,
} from "https://deno.land/x/deploykit@0.0.23/blueprint/k8s/operators/all.ts";

createMicroservice().with(
  addDeployment({ image: "my-image" }),
  addService({ port: 80 }),
  expose({ domain: "my-app.com" }),
).dump(
  { name: "my-app", namespace: "my-namespace", labels: { app: "my-app" } },
);
```

Run
`deno run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yshayy/deploykit/master/examples/deploy.ts`

Usage with kubectl:\
`deno run ./deploy.ts | kubectl apply -f -`

## Why Deno?

Deno brings back some of the script-y aspects of JS and the web, but with the
safety of Typescript. It has several advantages such as:

- No need for typescript toolchain (tsc, prettier, etc...)
- No need to manage dependencies or package.json or deployment project folder
- Easy to publish, import and share code pieces (blueprint/operators/scripts)
- Sandboxed security - scripts can output configuration files and nothing more

These capabilies allow us to easily create a single deploy.ts file that is easy
to manage, execute, extend, integrate in CI/CD.

## Why Typescript

TBD

## What's Inside

- generated/k8s - TS definitions for all k8s native resourcesn based on k8s
  OpenAPI defintions, some CRDs are also imported. (crds are defined
  [here](https://github.com/Yshayy/deploykit/blob/master/generated/k8s/sources.json))
- generators/openapi - library for generating TS files from open-api and CRD
  files currently tailored to k8s.
- blueprint - Library for creating, sharing and reusing high level abstractions
  of deployments
- blueprint/k8s - Base blueprint factory and operators for creating and
  manipulating common k8s resources
